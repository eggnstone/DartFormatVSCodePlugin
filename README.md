# DartFormat

**A formatter for Dart.**

Like dartfmt.  
But better ;)  
Because it's configurable.

Press `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`,` to format your code.

**Please note!**  
You have to install the [dart_format](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_format) package on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev) package to use this extension!  
Basically just call this from the command line:  
`dart pub global activate dart_format`

**Beta version!**  
Formatting the currently selected file already works.  
Formatting multiple files comes soon.
