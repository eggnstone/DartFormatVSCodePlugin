# DartFormat

**A formatter for Dart.**

Like dartfmt.  
But better ;)  
(Because it's configurable. (coming soon))

Press `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`,` to format your code.

**Please note!**  
You have to install the [dart_format](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_format) package on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev) package to use this extension!  
Basically just call this from the command line:  
`dart pub global activate dart_format`

**Beta version!**  
Formatting the currently selected file already works.  
Formatting multiple files comes soon.  
Configuring the formatter comes soon.  

Also available as a plugin for JetBrains (Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, ...)  
[DartFormat plugin at the JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/21003-dartformat)
